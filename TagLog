** V00-01-03  [Mon Mar 13 11:56:10 2006]
reduced verbosity

** V00-01-02  [Mon Mar 13 10:09:16 2006]
fixed  config files for uncalib rechit producers.
Now the weight method producer uses the latest cond DB objects 
and all config files use the trivial cond retreiver.

** V00-01-01  [Fri Mar 10 20:13:28 2006]
added EcalRecHitProducer that uses EcalRecHitSimpleAlgo to make
rechits from uncalib rechits using the global ADC-&gt;GeV scale
and the intercalib constants

** V00-01-00  [Thu Feb  2 18:50:48 2006]
adapted to the new EcalPedestals class that now uses DetId::rawid() to lookup pedestals for indivisual channels instead of the old channelId defined by eta and phi indices

** V00-00-04  [Tue Jan 10 15:17:47 2006]
added the analytic fit implemented by Alessandro Palma.
This is used for the analysis of the HV scan laser data of ECAL.

** V00-00-03  [Mon Nov 28 17:47:11 2005]
added new algorithm based on analytical fit to compute the pulse shape. currently this is a placeholder and the fit is not perfomed yet

** V00-00-02  [Thu Nov  3 15:57:28 2005]
removed any refernce to the obsolete (and now removed) object EcalMapping.
This tag is to be included in CMSSW_0_2_0-pre7 and later

** V00-00-01  [Thu Oct 27 17:40:13 2005]
First release of this packages in CMSSW_0_2_0-pre6.
this version includes the producer to make uncalibrated rechits,
basically pedestal-subtracted ADC counts, from ecal Dataframes
